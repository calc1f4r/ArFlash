## Flash Loan what are those? 🤔

A flash loan is a type of uncollateralized lending that allows users to borrow and repay a loan within a single transaction. This innovative financial tool is primarily used for arbitrage, collateral swapping, or self-liquidation of positions in DeFi applications. ⚡️


## Use-Cases For Novice 🌱

Flash loans might sound complicated, but they can be really cool and useful! Here are some simple ways you can use them:

- **Trading** 📈: Imagine you can buy something cheap and sell it for more money, all in one go. Flash loans help you do that quickly!
- **Swapping** 🔄: If you have one type of digital money but need another, flash loans can help you swap them without losing any value.
- **Fixing Mistakes** 🛠️: Sometimes, people make mistakes with their digital money. Flash loans can help fix those mistakes fast.

Flash loans are like magic tools in the world of digital money, making things easier and faster for everyone! ✨

### Use cases for Pero 🧑‍🚀

Experienced traders can leverage flash loans for more advanced strategies:

- **Arbitrage** 💹: Take advantage of price differences across multiple exchanges to make a profit.
